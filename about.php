                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p>We at Smart Gold aim to give customers a convenient method to get rid of their old jewellery and
                    gold
                    for cash money. Our company is trusted and safe, so you know that you’re receiving a fair and
                    honest
                    exchange for your Calgary gold. We have a mission to pay the top price for the gold and
                    jewellery
                    bring us.<br>

                    The majority of us have gold jewellery in our possession we do not use anymore, and it no longer
                    gives us joy. We keep the items hidden away in drawers or locked for safekeeping in the depths
                    of a
                    jewellery box.<br>

                    The gold items we’re keeping but don’t want are made from precious metals. With today’s gold
                    prices
                    at an all-time high, your unwanted items have significant cash value when you choose Smart Gold
                    Calgary.<br>

                    Smart Gold is a 100% Canadian-owned company. We strongly support recycling your Calgary gold
                    because
                    we want to do our part for the environment. Mining is hard on the planet, so we want to help by
                    recycling your gold.<br>

                    Our company services most of Canada, including (but not limited to) Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
                    Island, and the Northwest Territories.<br>

                    Contact us today if you have any questions about our company or your jewellery. We look forward
                    to
                    meeting you!</p>
