                <p>Are you looking for a gold buyer in Calgary? Smart Gold Calgary is a jewelry buyer near you. We buy
                    many precious metals. Our company will buy most types of gold from 8 to 24 karats. We also purchase
                    bars, dental gold, platinum, palladium, and rhodium jewelry. If you have labware lying around, we
                    can take it off your hands!<br><br>

                    Smart Gold Calgary is also a silver buyer. We accept metals of all conditions, whether perfect or
                    broken. Our silver buyers pride themselves on offering fair cash for the items you want to
                    sell.<br><br>

                    As jewelry buyers, we accept multiple types of jewelry—chains, rings, earrings, watches, bracelets,
                    and more. If you have coins, diamonds, scrap gold, gold or silver bullions, visit us in Calgary. We

                <p>We at Smart Gold want to help you clear out your unused items. If you have gold taking up space in
                    your home, bring it to our gold buyer near you! We care about reusing and recycling precious metals
                    because our gold buyers want to do their part for the environment. Mining can be hard on the planet
                    but bringing your old trinkets to our jewelry buyer can put the items to good use.<br><br>

                    Plus, who doesn’t want cash for the things you don’t use anymore? We have been buying gold in
